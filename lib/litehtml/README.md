# What is litehtml?

**litehtml** is the lightweight HTML rendering engine with CSS2/CSS3 support. Note, **litehtml** itself does not draw any text, pictures or other graphics and **litehtml** does not depend of any image/draw/font library. You are free to use any library to draw images, fonts and any other graphics. **litehtml** just parses HTML/CSS and places the HTML elements into right position (renders HTML). To draw the html elemens you have to implement the simple callback interface [document_container](https://github.com/litehtml/litehtml/wiki/document_container). This interface is really simple, check it! Note, the [document_container](https://github.com/litehtml/litehtml/wiki/document_container) implementation is required to render HTML correctly.

# Where litehtml can be used

**litehtml** can be used when you need to show the html-formated texts or even to create a mini-browser, but the using full-featured html engine is not possible. Usually you don't need something like WebKit to show some html tooltips or html-formated text, **litehtml** is much better for these.

## HTML Parser

**litehtml** uses the [gumbo-parser](https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser) to parse HTML. Gumbo is an implementation of the HTML5 parsing algorithm implemented as a pure C99 library with no outside dependencies. It's designed to serve as a building block for other tools and libraries such as linters, validators, templating languages, and refactoring and analysis tools.

## Compatibility

**litehtml** is compatible with any platform suported C++ and STL. For Windows the MS Visual Studio 2013 is recommended. **litehtml** supports both utf-8 and unicode strings on Windows and utf-8 strings on Linux.

## Support for HTML and CSS standards

Unfortunately **litehtml** is not fully compatible with HTML/CSS standards. There are lots of work to do to make **litehtml** as well as modern browsers. But **litehtml** supports most HTML tags and CSS properties. You can find the list of supported CSS properties in  [this table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvHXl5n24PuhdHdELUdhaUl4OGlncXhDcDJuM1JpMnc&usp=sharing). In the most cases the html/css features supported by **litehtml** are enough. Right now **litehtml** supports the pages with very complex html/css designs. As example the pages created with [bootstrap framework](http://getbootstrap.com/) are usually well formated by **litehtml**.

## Testing litehtml

You can [download the simple browser](http://www.litehtml.com/download.html) (**litebrowser**) to test the **litehtml** rendering engine.

The litebrowser source codes are available on GitHub:
  * [For Windows](https://github.com/litehtml/litebrowser)
  * [For Linux](https://github.com/litehtml/litebrowser-linux)
